# Suraj Melkani, PhD Candidate  
University of Florida – Soil, Water, and Ecosystem Sciences  

Welcome to my research portfolio. This GitHub serves as the software and modeling hub for my PhD research focused on:

- Soil Organic Carbon Dynamics  
- Digital Soil Mapping (EAA – Everglades Agricultural Area)  
- Soil Spectroscopy and Machine Learning  
- Precision Agriculture Decision Support Tools  

## Featured Projects

### 1. Everglades Growers DSS  
Interactive decision-support system that predicts soil organic matter, subsidence risk, and management guidance based on spatial selection within the EAA.
